          I found this assignment to be fun and not incredibly difficult once I got back in the swing
          of using html. I started investigating CSS to see ways that I could improve
          the page to be more modern and visually interesting.

          The challenging portions of this assignment are mainly because I have not
          really had much experience with html. So, I have to keep looking up tools
          I need to portray the website as I'd like.

          I also happen to own the domain jordanpearcey.com and I am going to use it to route to Github pages!

          I enjoyed this assignment because I like the process of design and it was fun and difficult to match
          everything up to the mock website image. It was more difficult than I had anticipated, due to how you
          can create a massive headache if you do not set things up properly from the get go. I had everything
          looking very good until I realized parts of the "twits" boxes were off, and upon tweaking them I ended
          up messing the whole thing up.

          It was pretty exciting getting to build an interactive site for the first time. I did not know any java-
          script before this course, but it has so many familiar elements to c++ that it is intuitive. That is not
          to say that this assignment was easy. Not by a long shot. I struggled to get started with this one and
          spent a good deal of time just going back over the materials in order to establish a starting point, but
          once I got comfortable it starting moving pretty quickly.

          My biggest challenge was implementing the livesearch function. I tried many attempts that ended in failure
          because I wasn't sure at first how to go about comparing the search input against the individual twits.
          I tried breaking each input down into individuals chars and using conditional logic in a for-loop to
          weed out the ones that did not match. However, the way I implemented this--it kept deleting entire twits
          from the DOM even if there were matches. Eventually, I decided to re-watch class materials until I could
          work it out.
          </p>
          <p>
          I think my biggest insight from this assignment was learning how to manipulate the DOM effectively. It was
          pretty cool to create the machinery behind the scenes of a website page. Using Campuswire, stackoverflow,
          re-watching lectures and re-reading notes, were all very helpful to figure things out. But I learned my 
          lesson about blindly trusting internet sources, even highly rated ones on Stackoverflow; some of them
          gave advice that would make a site vulnerable to attack (using inner-HTML). Good thing I referred back to
          class materials and asked questions on Campuswire.

          I googled so many things for this assignment! The most important searches I guess were figuring out how
          to build elements and add classes to the right objects (but this what taught in class very well too), and
          figuring out ways to implement the search functions. Overall this assignment was difficult and very 
          informative.
