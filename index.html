    <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
      <h4>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your
      current web development skills?</h4>
      <p>I have no formal web development experience. However, in the past,
      I have worked with html for some simple, personal sites and forums and,
      of course, my former Myspace page!</p>
      <h4>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h4>
      <p>So far, I have mainly learned C++ development in an academic
      setting without reach to the outside world. I hope to attain skills
      that will allow me to begin creating my own applications and webpages
      accessibe on the internet.</p>
      <h4>Have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?</h4>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <h4>Describe the most interesting fact about yourself or unique
      experience you have had.</h4>
      <p>I lived in Japan as a child due to my Dad's military service.
      While in Japan I had the opportunity to act in various commercials,
      as well as some limited video series--for teaching English. I even
      posed in a "19th century" photo featured in a commercial calendar,
      for the month of October! All this and I never learned Japanese...</p>
