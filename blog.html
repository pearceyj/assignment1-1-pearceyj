      I found this assignment to be fun and not incredibly difficult once I got back in the swing
      of using html. I started investigating CSS and javascript to see
      ways that I could improve the page to be more modern and visually interesting.

      The challenging portions of this assignment are mainly because I have not
      really had much experience with html. So, I have to keep looking up <thead>
        tools I need to portray the website as I'd like.
      </thead>

      I own the domain jordanpearcey.com and I am going to route to Github pages!
