          I found this assignment to be fun and not incredibly difficult once I got back in the swing
          of using html. I started investigating CSS to see ways that I could improve
          the page to be more modern and visually interesting.

          The challenging portions of this assignment are mainly because I have not
          really had much experience with html. So, I have to keep looking up tools
          I need to portray the website as I'd like.

          I also happen to own the domain jordanpearcey.com and I am going to use it to route to Github pages!
